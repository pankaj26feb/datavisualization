*** 
  The plot show the visualization based on ethinicity. The ethnicity are label with different colors. The x-axis denotes age and y-axis denotes department name.
  This plot describes the ethnicity with specific age on given department in Texas.We can seen different crime done by different ethinicity with particular age range.Since there are lot of distinct department name, we are having problem to
  generate all department so it is shrinked or truncated.
  Features of the graph :
  1.) User can drill down to see graph plot for specific ethinicty by taking off all other ethinicity in the label at top right.
  2.) User can narrow down to particular department by maximizing the scrollable 
  button on left side into department.
  3.) The plot will sum of the total crime on with specific age for each department.(i.e. count of crime done by each age in specific department.)
